The Virginia Military Institute is state funded military college founded in 1839 located in Lexington, VA.  VMI does not require it's cadets to commission into the military but rather leaves the choice up to them.  All four branches are available as an ROTC option to cadets as well.  VMI is probably most well known for it's ratline that it requires for all the members of the incoming freshmen class to go through.  In the ratline, the rats (freshmen) are mentoried by upper classmen that serve as their cadre.  Shortly after the end of the first semester, the rats have a "breakout" event where they earn their right as a cadet withing the corp and are no longer considered rats.  The current superintendent of VMI is General J.H. Binford Peay III.  More information about VMI can be found [Here](https://www.vmi.edu/about/)
