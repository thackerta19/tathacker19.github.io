Hello!  My name is Tyler Thacker and I am currently a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute.  I am in my Senior year and will graduate on May 16th with my Bachelor's in Computer Science.  I was lucky enough to be selected to participate in the FBI's internship program over the summer of 2018 and worked in Quantico, VA with a group of highly trained special agents.  One day in the future I hope to be a full-time employee with the FBI.  As far as my personal life style goes, I have many hobbies and things I am interested in.  I have played football for many years and love the sport, I even had the opprotunity to play for VMI's football team.  I also enjoy playing video games and watching Impractical Jokers on TV in my spare time.  I also enjoy eating food, my favorite food is chinese food... specifically Genral Tso's chicken.  I have two very loving parents, two brothers (one older and one younger), and a pet Pug.  I plan on updating this blog in the future so stay posted!  Thank you for reading!
